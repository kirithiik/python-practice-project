# Dice Roll Simulator (Python)

A simple command-line Dice Roll Simulator built using Python.
The program simulates rolling a six-sided dice and allows the user to roll repeatedly while keeping track of the total number of rolls.

## Features
- Simulates a dice roll (1–6)
- Allows the user to roll multiple times
- Tracks the total number of rolls
- Clean exit when the user chooses to stop

## Concepts Used
- Functions
- While loops
- Conditional statements
- Random number generation
- User input handling
- Program flow control

## How It Works
- The program asks the user whether they want to roll the dice
- If the user chooses yes, a random number between 1 and 6 is generated
- The roll count is updated and displayed
- The program continues until the user chooses to exit

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Run the program using:
   ```bash
   python dice_simulator.py
